    \subsection*{Elastic vs. In-Elastic}
    \begin{adjustwidth}{0.5cm}{0pt}
        In an ELASTIC collision, the kinetic energy of the SYSTEM is equal before and after the collision.  In an INELASTIC collision, the kinetic energy of the SYSTEM is NOT equal between the before and after of the collision.\newline\newline
        An elastic collision occurs when two objects collide and are physically the same after the collision as they were before the collision. An inelastic collision occurs when the physical shape of the objects involved has been altered and is different after compared to before the collision.

    \subsection*{Calculation Steps}
    \begin{flushleft}
        If you get stuck on a problem, try to use $P_{tot} = P_{tot}\prime$ and/or $E_{tot} = E_{tot}\prime$ to solve for what you need.
