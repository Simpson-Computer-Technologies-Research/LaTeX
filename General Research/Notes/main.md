# Electrons Wave-Particle Duality and Superposition
- The electron itself is a particle but it moves like a wave
- Because of superposition the electrons wave is in multiple positions at the same time.
- This is why when only one electron is shot through the double slits there is basically two electrons going through the slit at the same time (because of superposition)
- An since two electrons are going through the slit at the same time, and electrons also act as waves, deconstructive and constructive interference happens which forms a pattern on the screen
- Search up interference electron waves
