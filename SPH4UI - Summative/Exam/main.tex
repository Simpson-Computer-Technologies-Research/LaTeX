\subsubsection{Energy + 2D Momentum (10)}

\vspace{5pt}

\begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}
    Jeremy rolls a bowling ball with a mass of $6.7$ kg directly at a stationary
    bowling pin that has a mass of $3.0\times 10^{-3}$ kg. The bowling ball is 0.97m above the ground and moving
    $1.2\;m/s$ before Jeremy releases it. After the collision, the bowling ball rolls off at a $32\degree$ angle
    counter-clockwise with a velocity of $3.1\;m/s$. What is the after velocity of the bowling pin?
\end{minipage}
\hspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/bowling.png}
\end{minipage}
\subsubsection{Spring Energy + Inelastic Momentum (10)}

\vspace{5pt}

\begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}
    A child; Michael, with a mass of $20$ kg is running towards a rope at a velocity of $2.4\;m/s$. Michael sticks to the rope
    after their collision and swings forward. The rope is very old so when Michael reaches his highest peak, the rope breaks.
    Michael falls to the ground and luckily lands on a trampoline. The trampoline compresses $8.9\;cm$ before bouncing back
    to its original height.
