\subsection{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiple Forces on Bodies: The more $F_{f_{car1}} + F_{f_{car2}}$ the more gas is burned cuz of law of inertia
    \item Fletcher's Trolley: $F_T = F_T + F_f\;(\mu F_g)$

\subsection{Incline Plane + Projectile Motion (5)}
A $3.84 \times 10^3$ kg car is parked at the top of a hill $37.8$ m high and $24.6$ m wide inclined at an angle of 64$\degree$.
As the car rolls down the hill, the hill's thick grass creates friction on the cars wheels. The coefficient of
friction ($\mu$) is $7\times 10^{-2}$. After the car reaches the bottom of the hill, it falls
off of a cliff $64.9$ m high with a uniform horizontal velocity.

\noindent\textbf{Solve for each of the following:}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]

    A child; Michael, with a mass of $20$ kg is running towards a rope at a velocity of $2.4\;m/s$. Michael sticks to the rope

    to its original height.
